    <h1>Why does this website exist?</h1>
    <p>
Hello World! Ugh , that is really overused by tech folks. (now, including me) I'm making this website so that I can learn some basic coding. If all goes well, this site will simultaneously help me gain skills and act as a catalog of what I have learned. <br><br> I am starting with <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codeacademy</a>. They have been well recommended and I really like their tri-pane interface. (instruction, code, result) I am writing this in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and I am already a little bit confused as to how to communicate to Sublime that this an HTML document. I believe the file should end in .html and they have something called a workspace. IDK. I have a little bit of experience writing <em>very</em> basic HTML at my marketing job, but I'm mostly brand new. I'm only a paragraph in and I've used already 5 tags! </p>
    <img src="/images/Ron's Happy Dance.gif" alt="Ron's happy dance" height=”260" width=”500”>
    <p>Shoot. I've already hit a roadblock. When I opened the file in my browser I got this:</p>
    <img src="/images/Website Attempt 1.png" alt="Website Attempt 1" height=”837” width=”928”>
    <p>Back to Google.</p>
    <p>I can't figure out how put spaces in-between paragraphs even though I am using the br tag. Maybe that will come in once I know CSS? Also, I just realized that I don't know how to display tag properly without using it. <xmp><br></xmp> Ah, there.</p>
    <p>I just learned about tables! Now I can make this:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Column 1</th>
        <th>Column 2</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>42</td>
        <td>14</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">Blah Blah</td>
        <td>1984</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
